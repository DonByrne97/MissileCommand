# MissileCommand
Scripts used in the Missle Command C# tutorial I created for YouTube. 

As part of my C# programming tutorial, I taught developers how to make a simple "Missile Command" type game that focuses on several concepts, including objects moving at runtime, instantiating prefabs, and keeping track of game variables across a namespace.
